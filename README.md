# Building a Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Classifier to Identify Eucalyptus

[Initial Work](https://github.com/bwlambert/FloweringPolygons/blob/master/GLMClassifier.ipynb)
---
Locating adjacent Eucalypt and NonEucalypt polygons for training, inital tests with a Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Classifier approach.

---
Further work on the location selected above, including first plots of negative Log Likelihoods for classification of each pixel.

[Tinaroo](https://github.com/bwlambert/FloweringPolygons/blob/master/LandSat8_Tinaroo.ipynb)
---
Examination of classifier behavior in Tinaroo, including visualization of low confidence pixels, and accuracy statistics as confidence threshold is increased.

[Kirrama](https://github.com/bwlambert/FloweringPolygons/blob/master/LandSat8_Kirrama.ipynb)
---
Examination of classifier behavior in Kirrama, including visualization of low confidence pixels.  Demonstrates that an optimal nLL certainty cutoff can be identified which gives 98% Eucalyptus classification.
